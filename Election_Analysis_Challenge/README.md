# Election Analysis:

## Overview & Purpose of Project:
   
This project is to provide the insight of election results for three counties (Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe). Through this project which is built through Python script, insights like "Total Votes", "County wise voting turnouts", "Candidate wise voting numbers" and "voting percentage" and finally the "winner of the election" is derived.

All the Election insights have been derived out of the file called 'election_rseults' (which is a CSV file that has information like Ballot ID, county it belongs to and Candidate who got the votes).
